<!-- Paragraph One -->
<p>
    My name is D'Ante Grovner, and I'm from Wilmington, NC. I am an early college graduate with an associate degree in science, so I'm entering NC State University as a Junior. I'm starting out in the First Year Engineering program. I plan to CODA into Mechanical Engineering because I have a passion for learning about technology and discovering new ways to implement it into our daily lives.
</p>

<!-- Paragraph Two -->
<p>
    I decided to spend my summer in 2022 working for a non-profit food and resiliency hub to earn money towards college and gain valuable work experience. The work I did there was mainly oriented towards Agriculture, and I was able to get an internship through them with NC State. This internship was called the Food-Inspired Resilience and Equity (FIRE) Internship. During this internship, I was able to build connections with faculty in the NC State Agriculture department and other students across the state.
